## Description
Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.
## Solution
When the Python script is ran, we are given a number (51) in decimal base and asked to convert it into binary base. Simply plug the decimal base into an online converter such as [rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html) and convert it into binary base. 51 in decimal base converted to binary base is 110011, input it in the script to retrieve the flag.
