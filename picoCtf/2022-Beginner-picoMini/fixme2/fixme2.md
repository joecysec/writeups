### Description
Fix the syntax error in the Python script to print the flag.

In this task we're given a Python script, lets start by opening the script in an IDE.

** IMAGE PLACEHOLDER HERE

We are looking for a syntax error and on line 22 we find a syntax error. In this case, if flag = "": we can see that in an if statement it should be == instead of =. The solution is if flag == "":.
